# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game using JavaScript. The user competes against the computer, and the first to win 3 rounds is declared the winner.

## How to Play

1. When prompted, enter your choice between **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
2. The computer randomly selects its choice.
3. The game will compare both choices and declare the winner of each round.
4. The first player (either you or the computer) to win 3 rounds wins the match!

## Game Rules

- **Rock** beats **Scissors**
- **Scissors** beats **Paper**
- **Paper** beats **Rock**

If both the user and the computer choose the same option, the round results in a **draw**.
